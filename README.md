# hoymiles_proto

This library helps with talking to and simulating Hoymiles microinverters.

It uses *asyncio* and has various helper classes. While many things are obviously unfinished,
I hope the general approach is rather stable. My intention is to publish this on PyPi some day.

## Preparations

Execute:
1. `./gen_protos.py`
2. `./gen_message_classes.py`
